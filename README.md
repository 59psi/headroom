Headroom is a self-hosted inventory for serious hat collections. Snap a photo
and Claude Vision identifies the brand, model, and colors, estimates retail
price, and pulls live resale comps. The background is stripped automatically so
every hat floats on a synthwave canvas. Built mobile-first, runs on a Raspberry
Pi, secured for the open internet, looks like 1986.

## Why it exists

Hundreds of hats in identical cases means two daily problems: *"where is my
light-blue one?"* and *"what is all of this actually worth?"* Headroom answers
both — perceptual color search over every photo, a location breadcrumb on every
result, and three independent price signals per hat.

## What it does

**🧠 Identify**
- **Claude Vision analysis** — brand, specific model, tiered colors with hex,
  design notes, estimated retail price. One tool-use call per photo, prompt
  caching enabled.
- **Works without any keys** — background removal and dominant-color detection
  run locally (colors are read *only* from the hat's cutout mask, so the
  background can never contaminate them). Add a Google Vision key for
  logo-based brand detection as a fallback when Claude is unavailable.
- **Automatic background removal** — `rembg` (ONNX, runs on a Pi) turns every
  photo into a transparent PNG.
- **Colorway catalog** — harvests every "Model – Colorway" name circulating on
  the melinrecap resale market (including years of sold-out drops) to power
  autocomplete and purchase matching.

**🔎 Find**
- **Search by color** — tap a swatch (or pick any color) and hats rank by
  *perceptual* closeness (ΔE in LAB space) over their stored hex values. A hat
  whose secondary color matches still surfaces. "Light blue" works no matter
  what the analyzer called it.
- **Text search** — multi-term AND over name, brand, model, style, condition,
  size, colors, and room.
- **Find-it cards** — every result shows the photo, the name, and where it
  physically lives: `📍 Case A-012 · Office`.
- **QR case labels** — print a label sheet; scan a case's QR with your phone
  to open its contents.

**💰 Value**
- **Three price signals per hat** — Claude's retail estimate, eBay
  sold-comparable stats (Browse API), and a **live median resale price** from
  melinrecap's marketplace API (no scraping, no headless browser).
- **Real cost basis** — import order line items from your purchase emails;
  they match to hats and record what you *actually paid*, and when.
- **Valuation dashboard** — totals, retention %, top hats by value, realized
  value from sales, and a wear-rotation nudge.
- **Insurance-grade inventory report** — print-friendly HTML → Save as PDF.

**🧢 Live with it**
- **Rooms → Cases → Hats** with per-case capacity (Melin cases hold 3–4),
  type-exclusive cases, auto-sequenced display IDs.
- **3D-printable case rack** — a modular, stackable, supports-free rack that
  gives each Melin travel case its own slide-in bay. OpenSCAD source + STLs in
  [`hardware/melin-rack-v3.zip`](hardware/melin-rack-v3.zip) (OpenSCAD + STLs
  + ready-to-slice `.3mf` projects); print notes in
  [`hardware/`](hardware/README.md).
- **Wear tracking** — one tap logs a wear; get wear counts, cost-per-wear, and
  a list of hats that haven't seen the sun.
- **Three import paths** — single photo with crop/rotate, bulk import (100
  photos through a restart-surviving queue), or straight from the system share
  sheet (Android PWA share target; iOS Shortcut recipe included in-app).
- **Disposition tracking** — sold / gifted / traded / lost / trashed, soft
  delete with undo; sale prices feed realized value.
- **Append-only activity log** — every significant change, auto-pruned.

**🔐 Ship it to the internet**
- **Accounts** — first-run owner setup, argon2id passwords, revocable
  sessions, login rate limiting.
- **Passkeys** — sign in with Face ID / Touch ID (WebAuthn).
- **Everything gated** — the API *and* the photo files require login; raw API
  keys never leave the server (masked reads only).
- **Read-only share links** — show off the collection without handing out a
  login; revocable, optionally expiring.
- **One-command HTTPS** — a Caddy overlay with automatic Let's Encrypt certs.
- **Backups** — scheduled rolling tarballs + one-click download; documented
  restore.

## Run it

Pick how you want to reach it — every Docker mode is the base compose file plus
**one** front-door overlay (don't stack two). Below, `C` is shorthand for
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml`:

| How you want to run it | Command | Reach it at | Face ID / passkeys |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Default** (one host) | `docker compose up -d --build` | `http://localhost:8000` · `http://<ip>:8000` | ✅ on `localhost` only |
| **LAN name** | `C -f docker-compose.mdns.yml up -d --build` | `http://headroom.local:8000` | ❌ (plain HTTP) |
| **LAN, port 80** | `C -f docker-compose.http80.yml up -d --build` | `http://headroom.local` | ❌ (plain HTTP) |
| **LAN, HTTPS** | `C -f docker-compose.https-lan.yml up -d --build` | `https://headroom.local` | ✅ (trust Caddy's cert once) |
| **Internet** | `HEADROOM_DOMAIN=… C -f docker-compose.https.yml up -d --build` | `https://your-domain` | ✅ (Let's Encrypt) |
| **Bare metal** (no Docker) | `./scripts/setup.sh --no-docker` → uvicorn | `http://localhost:8000` | ✅ on `localhost` |
| **Dev** (hot reload) | uvicorn `--reload` + `npm run dev` | `http://localhost:5173` | — |

Passkeys/Face ID need a **secure context** — HTTPS or `localhost` — so the
plain-HTTP LAN modes are password-login only. The LAN overlays use host
networking (Linux/Pi only); details for each mode follow.

### Docker (recommended — works on Mac, Linux, Pi)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/59psi/headroom.git && cd headroom

# 2. Install + start a Docker engine (skips itself if one is already running)
./scripts/setup.sh --docker-only

# 3. Build + run, attached so you can watch the first boot
docker compose up --build
```

Step 2 installs a complete, Docker-Desktop-free engine:
[colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) + docker CLI + compose/buildx
via Homebrew on macOS, native Docker Engine via apt/dnf on Linux. If
`docker info` already works on your machine it changes nothing. **Linux:**
the script adds you to the `docker` group — log out/in (or `newgrp docker`)
before step 3.

When uvicorn reports it's listening, open http://localhost:8000 — the first
visit creates your **owner account**, then head to **Settings** to paste your
Anthropic API key. Once it works, Ctrl-C and relaunch in the background:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d    # detached; follow logs with: docker compose logs -f
```

> **The first build takes a few minutes** (it pre-downloads the rembg model
> so your Pi doesn't have to); later builds are cached. With `-d` your
> terminal returns immediately while the container is still building and
> booting — give it a minute before declaring it broken.

> Errors like **`unknown shorthand flag: 'd' in -d`**, **`docker: 'compose'
> is not a docker command`**, or **`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`**
> all mean your Docker install is incomplete. Step 2 fixes all of them.

**Putting it on the internet?** Use the HTTPS overlay — Caddy sidecar with
automatic Let's Encrypt certs, passkey identity configured from your domain:

```bash
HEADROOM_DOMAIN=hats.example.com \
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.https.yml up -d --build
```

See the [Operations guide](docs/OPERATIONS.md) for the full security posture.

### Find it on your LAN — `headroom.local`

The app advertises itself over mDNS, so devices on your network can reach it
at **http://headroom.local:8000** — no IP address to remember. macOS, iOS,
and Windows 10+ resolve `.local` names natively; on Linux install
`avahi-daemon` + `libnss-mdns`. Rename it with `HEADROOM_MDNS_HOSTNAME`
(disable with `HEADROOM_MDNS_ENABLED=false`).

**Docker needs one extra flag**: multicast can't cross Docker's bridge
network, so stack the mDNS overlay (host networking — Linux/Pi only):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mdns.yml up -d --build
```

Host networking only claims the ports the app actually binds (8000 here) —
the rest of the Pi is unaffected, and other services can keep running on
their own ports.

> **If `headroom.local` won't resolve but the raw IP works:** inside a Docker
> host-net container the responder binds the **detected LAN interface only**, so
> it can't leak onto `docker0`/`veth` and lose multicast (that leak is the usual
> cause). On a multi-homed host where auto-detection picks the wrong NIC, pin it
> with `HEADROOM_MDNS_INTERFACE=<lan-ip>`; set `HEADROOM_MDNS_INTERFACE=all` to
> fall back to advertising on every interface. `GET /api/settings/mdns` reports
> the advertised IP and any registration error.

**Prefer a clean port 80, no HTTPS?** Stack the plain-HTTP overlay instead — a
Caddy sidecar serves **http://headroom.local** (and `http://<host-ip>`) on
port 80 with no certificate to trust:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.http80.yml up -d --build
```

Trade-off: `http://` isn't a secure context, so passkeys / Face ID aren't
offered — password login only. Use one front-door overlay at a time
(`mdns` → `:8000`, `http80` → `:80`, or `https-lan` → `:443`).

### HTTPS on the LAN — Face ID / passkeys at `https://headroom.local`

Browsers only offer passkeys in a **secure context**, and Let's Encrypt can't
issue certificates for `.local` names — so the LAN HTTPS overlay fronts the
app with Caddy using its **built-in local CA**. You trust that CA once per
device; after that the LAN name gets a real padlock and Face ID sign-in
works. Password login never needed any of this.

**Prerequisites:** a Linux/Pi Docker host (the overlay uses host networking
for mDNS), with ports **80, 443, and 8000** free on that host.

**1. Start it** — use this overlay *instead of* `docker-compose.mdns.yml`
(mDNS + host networking are built in):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.https-lan.yml up -d --build
```

On first boot Caddy mints a root CA and a `headroom.local` certificate, the
app advertises `https://headroom.local` over mDNS, and the passkey identity
(`HEADROOM_RP_ID` / `HEADROOM_ORIGIN`) is set to the LAN name automatically.

**2. Export Caddy's root certificate** (from the Docker host, in the repo
directory):

```bash
docker compose cp caddy:/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt headroom-ca.crt
```

**3. Trust it on each device** (passkeys require a *trusted* certificate,
not just any TLS):

- **iPhone / iPad**: AirDrop or email `headroom-ca.crt` to the device, tap
  it, then **Settings → Profile Downloaded → Install**. Finally — easy to
  miss — enable it under **Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust
  Settings**.
- **Mac**: double-click the file to add it to Keychain Access, open it, and
  set *When using this certificate* to **Always Trust**.
- **Android**: Settings → Security → More → Encryption & credentials →
  **Install a certificate → CA certificate**.
- **Windows**: right-click → Install Certificate → Local Machine → place in
  **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**.

**4. Verify**: open **https://headroom.local** — you should see a padlock
and no warning. The Settings page's **LAN Discovery** card shows the exact
URL being advertised. Then add a passkey under **Settings → Account** and
sign in with Face ID.

**If something's off:**

- *Name doesn't resolve* — Linux clients need `avahi-daemon` + `libnss-mdns`;
  everything else resolves `.local` natively. Check the LAN Discovery card
  (or `docker compose logs | grep -i mdns`) to confirm the app is advertising.
- *Still a certificate warning* — on iOS the profile install alone isn't
  enough; the Certificate Trust Settings toggle in step 3 must be on.
- *No Face ID prompt* — passkeys are bound to the domain they were created
  on. One registered at `localhost` or a public domain won't be offered at
  `headroom.local`; add a new passkey while on the LAN name.
- *Port conflict on 80/443* — something else on the host owns them; stop it
  or fall back to the plain mDNS overlay (password login, no padlock).

Renaming the host (`HEADROOM_MDNS_HOSTNAME=hats`) carries through everything
— cert, mDNS name, and passkey identity become `hats.local` on the next
`up --build`.

### Local (no Docker)

Prereqs: git + curl. The setup script installs everything else it needs —
uv, Python 3.12, Node 20+, backend and frontend deps — via Homebrew on macOS
and apt/dnf on Linux.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/59psi/headroom.git && cd headroom
./scripts/setup.sh --no-docker   # drop the flag to also install a Docker engine
uv run uvicorn headroom.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

That's it — setup builds the SPA, and the backend serves it at
http://localhost:8000.

### Dev mode (hot reload)

```bash
# terminal 1 — backend (port 8000)
uv run uvicorn headroom.app:app --reload

# terminal 2 — frontend dev server (port 5173, proxies /api + /uploads to :8000)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

---

## Updating

```bash
git pull
docker compose up --build -d     # Docker
# — or —
./scripts/setup.sh --no-docker   # bare metal: re-sync deps + rebuild SPA, then restart uvicorn
```

**Schema changes are handled automatically** — on every boot, `init_db()`
applies inline SQLite migrations (`ALTER TABLE` for new columns, `CREATE
TABLE` for new tables), so an old database upgrades itself the first time
the new version starts. There's no separate migrate step — but there's no
downgrade path either, so **take a backup before major upgrades**
(Settings → Download backup, or grab the latest scheduled tarball from
`/data/backups/`). Your data always survives a rebuild: the database and
photos live in the `headroom-data` volume, not the image.

The footer shows the running version — compare against the
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md). Details in
[OPERATIONS.md §5](docs/OPERATIONS.md#5-upgrades).

## Configuring the AI features

The AI features need an Anthropic API key. **The DB-stored key always wins**
over the environment variable, so you can ship a docker-compose default and
let users override it from the UI.

| Source | When | Set via |
|---|---|---|
| **Database** (preferred) | Set from the Settings page; persists across restarts | UI: Settings → Claude API Key |
| **Environment** (fallback) | Useful as a default for fresh installs | `HEADROOM_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |

### No Claude key? The fallback

Uploads never depend on Claude. Without a key (or when a Claude call fails),
a basic fallback runs instead and the hat gets `analysis_status = "fallback"`:

- **Colors — always available, no key needed.** Dominant colors are extracted
  locally from the background-removed cutout's alpha mask, so only actual hat
  pixels count.
- **Brand — optional, via Google Cloud Vision logo detection.** Create an API
  key at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/vision.googleapis.com)
  (enable the *Cloud Vision API*, then *Credentials → Create API key*) and
  paste it in **Settings → Google Vision Key**. Free tier is 1,000
  requests/month — plenty.

Model name, price estimate, and design notes stay empty in fallback mode —
drop a Claude key in later and hit **Reanalyze** on any hat to upgrade.

### Resale prices (Melin)

Melin hats get a **live median asking price** from melinrecap.com's public
marketplace API (it's a Treet marketplace on Sharetribe Flex — we use the
same anonymous API its own frontend uses), scoped to your exact model when
enough listings match, plus a deep link to browse the comps. Degrades to
link-only if the API is unreachable.

## Running on a Raspberry Pi

The Docker image is multi-arch (amd64 + arm64). On a Pi 4/5 running 64-bit
Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu Server:

```bash
# Build on the Pi (slow first build, fine after)
docker compose up --build -d

# Or build on a beefier machine and push:
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 \
  -t your-registry/headroom:latest --push .
```

The default `u2netp` rembg model is 4.7MB and runs in 5–15 seconds per photo
on a Pi 4. Photos, database, and backups live in the `headroom-data` volume —
see [OPERATIONS.md §4](docs/OPERATIONS.md#4-backups--restore) for the backup
and restore procedure.

---

## Development

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh                           # One-shot setup (--help for flags)
uv run uvicorn headroom.app:app --reload     # Backend (port 8000)
cd frontend && npm run dev                   # Frontend (port 5173)
cd frontend && npm run build                 # Type-check + production SPA build
cd frontend && npm run typecheck             # Type-check only
uv run pytest                                # All tests
uv run pytest tests/test_search.py -k color  # Single test
```

Tests use in-memory SQLite, stub out `rembg`, authenticate through a seeded
test session, and never call the Anthropic, Google, eBay, or Sharetribe APIs
— every external boundary has a test seam.

**Frontend** — React 19, Vite, TypeScript, TanStack Query, zero UI framework:
hand-rolled synthwave design system in two CSS files, PWA-installable, native
`<datalist>` autocomplete, hand-rolled WebAuthn plumbing. No component
library, no CSS framework, no state-management dependency.

**Data model**: Rooms → Cases → Hats. Cases are type-exclusive (regular or
beanie) with per-case capacity. The Default Room cannot be deleted. Disposed
hats keep their history but free their slot.
