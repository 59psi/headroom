[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-02 — _"Outrun"_

The big one. Full UI rebuild + AI-powered hat identification.

### Added
- **Claude Vision analysis** for every uploaded hat photo. Single tool-use call
  to `claude-sonnet-4-6` returns brand, specific model name, model confidence
  (`high` / `medium` / `low`), style descriptor, design notes, primary /
  secondary / tertiary / accent colors with name + hex + tier, and an estimated
  new retail price in USD. Prompt caching enabled on the system prompt.
  (`src/headroom/services/claude_analysis.py`)
- **Background removal** via [`rembg`](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg)
  with ONNX runtime. Hat photos save as transparent PNGs and float on the
  synthwave canvas. Default model is `u2netp` (4.7 MB) for Pi-friendliness;
  swap to `u2net` / `isnet-general-use` via `HEADROOM_REMBG_MODEL`.
  (`src/headroom/services/background_removal.py`)
- **Hat record** now stores: `brand`, `model_name`, `model_confidence`,
  `style_descriptor`, `design_notes`, `estimated_new_price`,
  `estimated_new_price_source`, `resale_price`, `resale_price_source`,
  `resale_price_url`, `resale_checked_at`, `analysis_status`, `analysis_error`,
  `analyzed_at`. `HatColor` gets a `tier` column.
- **Melin Recap deep-linking**: hats Claude identifies as Melin get a link to
  the matching filter page on melinrecap.com for live resale comparables.
  (`src/headroom/services/melin_recap.py`)
- **Settings page — Claude API key management.** Get / Set / Delete / Test
  connection endpoints; stored in DB (masked on read) with env-var fallback.
  (`src/headroom/routes/settings.py`, `tests/test_settings_api.py`)
- **`POST /api/hats/{id}/reanalyze`** — re-run Claude on an existing photo
  without re-uploading.
- **AppSetting** key/value model + table for app-level configuration.
  (`src/headroom/models/app_setting.py`)
- **Dockerfile** (multi-stage, multi-arch amd64+arm64, runs as non-root
  `headroom` user, pre-caches rembg model) and **docker-compose.yml** for
  one-command Pi deployment.
- **CHANGELOG.md** (this file) and a real **`.gitignore`**.

### Changed
- **Total frontend rebuild** — dropped Bootstrap 5 entirely. Synthwave / retro-80s
  design system: near-black canvas, neon hot-pink + cyan accents, sunset
  gradients, perspective grid background (desktop), Audiowide / Orbitron /
  Inter / JetBrains Mono typography, glow effects on primary actions, animated
  carousel with swipe gestures, glassmorphic modals + lightbox. CSS bundle
  shrunk from ~250 KB (Bootstrap) to **29 KB**.
- **Mobile / iPad first.** All layouts start single-column and progressively
  enhance. Tap targets ≥ 44 px. Bottom nav is the primary nav on portrait
  devices; top nav only renders at `lg+`. `viewport-fit=cover` and safe-area
  padding for notched devices.
- **Photo upload pipeline** is now: upload → resize/HEIC convert → background
  removal → Claude Vision → persist. Each step degrades gracefully. The
  canonical photo is the transparent PNG when bg-removal succeeds, the JPEG
  otherwise.
- **Search** now indexes brand alongside style/condition/size/colors/room.
- **Hats listing + gallery cards** show brand + model when known.
- **Hat detail page** redesigned with discrete sections: Identification (brand
  / model / confidence / Claude's design notes), Photo + Reanalyze, Valuation
  (new + resale tiles + Melin Recap CTA), Specs, Case, Color palette with
  tiered breakdown.
- **Edit Hat page** lets you override every Claude-derived field manually.
- **Database migrations** extended to add the new hat columns + `tier` on
  `hat_colors` + the new `app_settings` table. Existing DBs upgrade in place.

### Removed
- `colorthief` + `webcolors` dependencies (replaced by Claude Vision).
- `src/headroom/services/color_service.py`.
- Bootstrap CSS + JS imports from the frontend.

### Security
- Dockerfile runs as non-root user `headroom` (uid 1000) — addresses the
  semgrep finding about implicit-root containers.
- Inline-migration DDL is now fully static — no f-string interpolation into
  `text()` even for trusted column names.
- API keys are masked on read; only the prefix and last four characters are
  ever sent over the wire.

### Notes / known limitations
- The pipeline runs synchronously inside the upload request, so a hat upload
  with Claude + bg removal can take 5–15 s on a Pi. A future release may move
  this to a background queue.
- Melin Recap doesn't expose a stable JSON API and the listing page is
  client-rendered, so the resale_price field stays null and we surface a
  browse link instead of fabricating a number.
